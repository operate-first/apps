        description: FybrikApplication provides information about the application
          whose data is being operated on, the nature of the processing, and the data
          sets chosen for processing by the application. The FybrikApplication controller
          obtains instructions regarding any governance related changes that must
          be performed on the data, identifies the modules capable of performing such
          changes, and finally generates the Plotter which defines the secure runtime
          environment and all the components in it.  This runtime environment provides
          the application with access to the data requested in a secure manner and
          without having to provide any credentials for the data sets.  The credentials
          are obtained automatically by the manager from the credential management
          system.
