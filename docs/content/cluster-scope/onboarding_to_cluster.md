# Onboard Project

Onboarding a Project to GitHub requires creating various OpenShift resources to create namespaces, groups, etc. Luckily
we have a Jupyter Notebook that automates most of this process.

For onboarding, you are expected to run the Jupyter notebook found in [here][1].

You can use the Operate First JupyterHub instance to run this notebook. If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, then you can check out an overview [here][2].

The notebook is already made available under the "HitchHiker's Guide" image. So simply select this from the JH spawner.
Be sure to use a container size bigger than the 'small' offering. If you're runbook feels slow, try using a bigger
container size.
