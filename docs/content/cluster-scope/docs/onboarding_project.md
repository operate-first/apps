# Onboard Project

Onboarding a Project to GitHub requires creating various OpenShift resources to create namespaces, groups, etc. Luckily
we have a Jupyter Notebook that automates most of this process.

For onboarding, you are expected to create an issue in the `operate-first/support` repository using this [**Onboard to a cluster** template](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues/new?assignees=first-operator&labels=kind%2Fonboarding%2Cscript%3Ascripts%2Fonboarding.sh%2Ctask-type%3Abash%2Crepo%3Aapps&template=4_onboarding_to_cluster.yaml&title=NEW+PROJECT%3A+%3Cname%3E).
