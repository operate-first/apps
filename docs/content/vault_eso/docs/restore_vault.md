# Restoring vault

## Pre-requisites
* Unseal keys and root token for the snapshot
* Project admin access to the namespace being restored (referred to as `${VAULT_NS}` in this doc)
* Vault CLI
* Kustomize CLI
* OC CLI

## Steps
* Retrieve the most recent Vault Snapshot from one of the following locations:
  * Snapshot Backup S3 bucket on [Smaug Cluster][smaugS3Bucket]. Use this s3 endpoint: s3-openshift-storage.apps.smaug.na.operate-first.cloud
  * Snapshot Backup PVC [here][pvc]. You can use [this pod][toolpod] to access the pvc.
* Login to an OCP cluster
* Go to https://github.com/operate-first/apps/tree/master/vault/overlays
* Find the overlay needing to be deployed
* Navigate to this cluster overlay and run `kustomize build . | oc -n ${VAULT_NS} apply -f -`
* Follow the instructions [here][2], ignoring the `helm install..` portion
  * Use `http://opf-vault-0.opf-vault-internal:8200` when joining `opf-vault-1` and `opv-vault-0`

So far we've installed a new Vault instance, to restore an instance from our old backup:

* Login to the new instance: `vault login -address=$VAULT_ADDR`, use the root token to log in
* Follow the instructions [here][3] to restore the snapshot
* Login to each pod again and unseal using the unseal keys for the snapshot vault.
