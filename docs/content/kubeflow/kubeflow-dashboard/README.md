# Kubeflow Access

> Note: Currently our Kubeflow deployments are no longer active, see [this discussion](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues/435) for details.

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/kubeflow/) is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes.

An instance of Kubeflow is available for use in OperateFirst.

You can access the Kubeflow dashboard with the following url.

- URL: http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/

There is a demo profile (`kf-demo`) with limited resources set up in our Kubeflow instance. This profile is accessible publicly [here](http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/?ns=kf-demo).
