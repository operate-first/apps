# ArgoCD onboarding procedure

We have an ArgoCD instance deployed on MOC that can be used to deploy OpenShift resources located on a Git Repository.

The ArgoCD instance is deployed on [MOC Infra][1] cluster.

Each team is given an [ArgoCD Project][2] that has an allow-list of clusters and namespaces to which they can deploy.
They also have an allow-list of resources they can deploy within those namespaces. These restrictions exist to prevent
teams from being able to use ArgoCD to deploy cluster scoped resources, or resources onto other team's namespaces. You
can browse the projects [here][3] to get an idea of the current set of permissions. Note that for most projects,
majority of these permissions are inherited from the [global project][4].

Teams are given edit access (for ui/cli console) to their ArgoCD Projects using OpenShift RBAC and OpenShift Groups.

The following steps should be completed to fully onboard and enable a team to use ArgoCD to deploy `Applications` to
their ArgoCD `Projects`.

> Note: ArgoCD Projects should not to be confused with OpenShift Projects.

## Pre-requisites
Team requesting ArgoCD access must have been onboarded to the cluster. See [here][5].

Please fork/clone the [operate-first/apps][6].

**During this whole setup, we'll be working within this repository.**

## OpenShift Group

To add multi-tenancy support, we require the team to have an OpenShift group on the Infra cluster on which our ArgoCD
instance resides. This OpenShift group should include all the people belonging to the team that will need write-level
access to applications belonging to the team's ArgoCD Project (explained later). Existing OCP groups and their
membership can be found [here][19]. If you do not have a group to which you belong, you can create a new one and add
yourself and associated members by following the instructions [here][20].

> Note: We use teams/project names interchangeably throughout this doc as all ArgoCD projects (for end-users) are named
> after their team names picked during the cluster onboarding process.

## Create project directories for this repository
Pick an environment/cluster this team will be deploying to. Navigate to
`apps/argocd/overlays/moc-infra/applications/envs/<env>/<cluster>/`, where `<env>` and `<cluster>` correspond to the
cluster you intend to deploy manifests to via ArgoCD. For example if deploying to `Smaug` cluster, you will navigate to
`apps/argocd/overlays/moc-infra/applications/envs/moc/smaug/`. Now create a folder here named after your `<team-name>`.

Teams should be directed [here][9] for instructions on where to create their ArgoCD Applications. All Applications
should be pointed to the team's [ArgoCD Project][3] (i.e. the `project` field in the ArgoCD [Application][7] manifest),
see below for instructions on adding an ArgoCD Project.

## Create the ArgoCD Project
The team will need a dedicated [ArgoCD Project][2] for their [ArgoCD Applications][7]. The ArgoCD project should be
added [here][3].

A typical project will look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: <team-name>
  labels:
    project-template: global
spec:
  destinations:
    - namespace: '<team-namespace-prefix>-*'
      name: '<cluster-name>'
    - namespace: '<namespace-name>' # if there is no generic team name prefix, then specify namespaces individually
      name: '<cluster-name>'
  sourceRepos:
    - '*'
  roles:
    - name: project-admin
      description: Read/Write access to this project only
      policies:
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, get, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, create, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, update, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, delete, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, sync, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, override, <team-name>/*, allow
        - p, proj:<team-name>:project-admin, applications, action/*, <team-name>/*, allow
      groups:
        - <team-openshift-group>
        - operate-first
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
    - group: ''
      kind: Namespace
  namespaceResourceWhitelist:
  ....
```

Some notes:

* Ensure that the `spec.destinations` field contains a prefix for the team's namespaces. The team will be required to
prefix their namespaces with this attribute if they want ArgoCD to be able to deploy to them, any other namespaces not
following the prefix will need to be added manually under this field. See additional notes for more details.
* Ensure `operate-first` is added into the `roles.groups` for each role. This allows the operate-first team to help
diagnose issues.
* `namespaceResourceWhitelist` generally contains the list of resources a project `admin` has access to. In most cases
the `namespaceResourceWhitelist` inherited from the [global project][4] should be sufficient. However, teams can add
additional resources here if they are not covered by the global project.
* `<cluster-name>` should be one of `smaug, infra, curator, osc-cl1` (see `metadata.name` [here][19] for a
 full list).

Ensure that the ArgoCD project is included in the `kustomization.yaml` [here][11].

## Enable OpenShift auth to ArgoCD Console
By default, all users should be able to see the [ArgoCD console][12]. To be able to make changes to applications
belonging to the team's ArgoCD Project (via the cli or ui), the team will need to be able to log into the console with
appropriate access. This is accomplished by adding the team's OpenShift group mentioned in the beginning under the dex
config [here][13]. You can find your OpenShift group within this list [here][19].

## Give team read access to non-app ArgoCD resources

Append this [list][14] and give the team the `standard-user` role. The group will correspond to the team's OCP group.
For example if onboarding the team `someteam` you would append the following to this file:

```yaml
g, someteam, role:standard-user
```

## Additional Notes:

### Namespace Prefix
An ArgoCD project allows us to ensure that a team cannot deploy applications onto another team's namespace via ArgoCD.

We accomplish this by allowing teams to add the namespaces that they will be deploying to in their ArgoCD Project CR
under the `spec.destinations.` field. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: example-project
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destinations:
  - namespace: guestbook
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
...
```

The project above can only deploy into the `guestbook` namespace in the host cluster.

It can get bit tedious having to always require a team to submit a pr updating the `spec.destinations` to include new
namespaces their project applications can deploy onto, so we can use wildcards to include a set of namespaces that begin
with a prefix. For example, the `thoth` team has the following prefix in their `spec.destinations`:

```yaml
spec:
  destinations:
    - namespace: 'thoth-*'
      server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
```

Now, as long as all thoth team's namespaces have `metadata.name` beginning with a `thoth-` prefix, they can deploy into
these namespaces using ArgoCD Applications that are part of the `thoth` project.
