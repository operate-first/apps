# Access JupyterHub

Access to JupyterHub is open to the public. All you need is a GitHub account.

Our JupyterHub instance on the `smaug` cluster can be found [here][1]. Login using the `operate-first` option, and you will be redirected to the JH spawner UI. Select any notebook, a suitable size, and start the server.
