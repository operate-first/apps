# Add a Grafana dashboard to OperateFirst Grafana

To be able to include your dashboards in Grafana, you will need to add a `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource. This custom resource is defined as a yaml file that can remotely reference the dashboard contents from a specified URL and falls back to an embedded json only if the URL can not be resolved.

An example `grafana-dashboard-example.yaml` template is shown below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
kind: GrafanaDashboard
metadata:
  name: grafana-dashboard-from-url
  labels:
    app: grafana
spec:
  customFolderName: ${DASHBOARD_FOLDER} # Pi
  name: grafana-dashboard-from-url.json
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator/master/deploy/examples/remote/grafana-dashboard.json
```

In this template, all you need to do is update:

1. `metadata.name` - the dashboard name
2. `spec.url` - the URL pointing to the location of your dashboard JSON file

Pick a suitable `metadata.name`, ensure that its unique in the [`grafana/overlays/moc/smaug/dashboards`][1] folder.

Save this file under `grafana/overlays/moc/smaug/dashboards/${DASHBOARD_FOLDER}/grafana-dashboard-example.yaml`.

Make sure to create a kustomization inside your '${DASHBOARD_FOLDER}'

```bash
$ cd ${DASHBOARD_FOLDER}
$ kustomize create --autodetect
```

Then add it to `grafana/overlays/moc/smaug/dashboards/kustomization.yaml` by running the following:

```bash
$ cd grafana/overlays/moc/smaug/dashboards
$ kustomize edit add resource ${DASHBOARD_FOLDER}
```

### Backing Up Your Dashboard:
Grafana is redeployed frequently, such as during an automatic operator update or when a new dashboard is added via a pull request. Please make sure to backup any dashboards you have created through the Grafana UI.

To export your dashboard click the share icon at the top dashboard menu. Click the "Export" tab and you can now save a JSON file of your dashboard.

To import your dashboard click the "+" icon in the side menu, and then click "Import." There you can either import via JSON file, dashboard url, or via panel json. For more details on how to import/export see [the Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/).
