## Grafana Monitoring Dashboards

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana) is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization tool. It allows you to query, create dashboards, explore, and alert on metrics when connected to supported data sources.

We use Grafana to visualize the metrics that we source from our [User Workload Monitoring][../uwm]. These monitoring dashboards are useful for visualizing the metrics (such as Prometheus metrics) collected from the applications to track and analyze the system's overall health.

The dashboards can be altered, saved and reused as per your specific monitoring needs.

Dashboards can be represented by the `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource or by their raw `JSON` files. You can find example monitoring dashboards defined in separate `JSON` files for each of the Operate First managed applications in our [apps repo](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/tree/master/grafana/base/dashboards). For more information on how the Grafana dashboards are defined, please refer to [this documentation](https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator/blob/master/documentation/dashboards.md).

# Get Access to Grafana

Grafana can be accessed at: https://grafana.operate-first.cloud/

You will need to be onboarded to access the UI, this can be self serviced, please follow the instructions [here](map_groups_to_roles.md) to do so. You will need to belong to an OCP `group` in order to gain access, current list of groups and their belonging users can be found [here](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/tree/master/cluster-scope/base/user.openshift.io/groups). If you do not belong to one, please create one, and then include this group in the `smaug` cluster overlay [here](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/blob/master/cluster-scope/overlays/prod/moc/smaug/kustomization.yaml).

## Adding the Dashboards

To add your dashboards to Grafana, you will need to create a `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource. To do this, you can follow the instructions available [here](add_grafana_dashboard.md).

## Using the Dashboards

Grafana dashboards can easily be exported and imported, either from the UI or from the HTTP API.
Dashboards are exported in Grafana JSON format, and contain everything you need (layout, variables, styles, data sources, queries, etc) to import the dashboard at a later time.

You can import these dashboards in Grafana either by pasting the dashboard JSON text directly into the text area or directly uploading the JSON file. Make sure to add/connect your [data sources](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/) to Grafana and pick what data source you want the dashboard to use.

For more details on importing/exporting dashboards, you can refer to the Grafana documentation [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/).
