## Common errors



### ValueError: Invalid decryption key

When rebooting superset, the initcontainer may crash and report `ValueError: Invalid decryption key` in the logs.

To fix this you may have to set the secret key to null so it may be refreshed. Follow these steps:

Run the following:

> NOTE: that running the following will clear the passwords for the databases in superset, and will need to be re-entered

```bash
$ oc rsh ${SUPERSET_DB_POD}
sh-4.2$ psql
postgres=# \connect supersetdb
supersetdb=# UPDATE public.dbs SET password = null;
supersetdb=# UPDATE public.dbs SET encrypted_extra = null;
```

### Duplicate key value violates unique constraint

When rebooting superset, the init container might report `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`.

This happens when [oauth mapping][oauth-mapping] has overlapping users. If one user is in multiple groups then it will
try to add the user twice, but run in to a conflict. Ensure that this is not the case.

### Trino Error in Superset

If you keep seeing "Trino errors show up" and in super logs you see:
```
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))
INFO:trino.exceptions:failed after 3 attempts
```
Try going to `Data > Databases` at the top, open edit panel for `opf-trino` database. Test the connection.
If it reports an error, try adding in the password again where it says `XXX..` and see if that works.
